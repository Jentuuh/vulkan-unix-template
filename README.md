# vulkan-linux-template
A starter template for Vulkan projects on the Linux operating system. This template is based on [Brendan Galea's ](https://github.com/blurrypiano/littleVulkanEngine) excellent tutorial series on Vulkan. The template has already set up the following things: 

* Physical + logical device setup
* Swapchain creation and management
* Pipeline creation and management (properties are rather default)
* Descriptor set creation and management
* Buffer helper object to simplify buffer operations
* Window creation and management
* Loading of game objects (using tinyobjloader, only supports .obj files though)
* Simple camera movement through keyboard commands (WASD, QE, arrows)
